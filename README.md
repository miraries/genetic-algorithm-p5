> An implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the Travling Salesman Problem (TSP). Uses p5.js to visualize the solving and c3.js to graph the fitness. Generations are regenerated much slower than without the libraries, this is for visualization and experimentation with hyperparameters only. It is however possible to reach a near-optimal solution.
